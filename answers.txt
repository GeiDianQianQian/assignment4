1. In my opinion, temperatures is not a good way to predict population density.
Because we can get that they have no relationship through observing the output
graph. The points in the scatter plot can be formed a line which means they have
no linear relationship so that using temperature to predict population density
is not a good idea.

2. Json is easy to change the data inside. For big data, if people change data,
it is hard to check and search. In this project, we want to insure that the
data will keep the same. Therefore, use gzip to make sure that the data in the
document will not be changed.
