Movie Title Entity Resolution -> average_ratings.py
 - Give file movie_list.txt and movie_ratings.csv
 - The purpose is to determine the average rating for each movie.
 - There are some completely-incorrect titles that have nothing to do with the movie list which should be ignored.
 - Produce a CSV file (output.csv) with 'title' as the first column, and (average) 'rating' rounded to two decimal places as the second. The output should be sorted by title and include only movies with ratings in the data set.
